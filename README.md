AI Based Blockchain Net
Leveraging AI to enhance blockchain consensus and performance
2. Project Description
Overview:

Provide a concise description of what the project does. For example:
"This project demonstrates a novel approach to blockchain consensus by integrating AI-based computations. It uses performance metrics of nodes (such as uptime, latency, and throughput) to compute a dynamic trust score, which is then combined with the node's stake to probabilistically select a block proposer."
Key Features:

AI-driven trust score calculation
Weighted random selection based on dynamic performance metrics
Simplified simulation of an AI-enhanced blockchain consensus mechanism
